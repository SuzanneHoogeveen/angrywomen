11,"This study was about whether we can make inferences about a person based on a description of their reaction in a particular situation. Singular incidents might sometimes provide us with good insight on whether a person will meet our expectations (like a 'blink'). On the other hand, a singular description of someone's response might be very misguided and lead us to biased or very wrong inferences, especially if we extrapolate one incident and assume it to reflect on a person's behavior or ability. Maybe if we had access to more information on their answers or about their previous role and responsibilities, we would be able to make more accurate predictions about their personality and what their wage should be. Also, we do not have much information on the role they are applying for so it is hard to come up with a number for their wage, and that number comes almost arbitrarily.

He could have copied the materials (that should be done!), left together, managed time better, managed client better, and so on and so forth. 

But he didn't admit any of it. He directly blamed his co-worker. 

But what if it were a woman? I think I would still think the above line items, but probably I wouldnt be that harsh on her, given she is atleast brave enough to voice her opinions. 

I would not call it sexism or favoritism. This is because women have already been criticised for being ""bossy"". While being leader is good, and bossy is not, I would prefer a bossy woman over a submissive woman. But when it comes to men, men are in general more commanding and entitled. So I would prefer a humble man over a commanding man in general.

The other thing this study could be about is gender discrimination - knowing that the candidate is a female, do we think she deserves to get paid less, and see the loss of the company's account more seriously than if she was male. Also, the fact that she says, ""i was sad..."" may feed the subconscious bias of people thinking that women = emotional, and therefore not as competent as men.

If they outlined the actions they took afterwards, and some examples to ensure it didn't happen, it shows recovery, adaptability and the ability to not be easily deterred. Then you'd feel comfortable giving responsibility to someone like that. I also though, am not sure if the candidate is perhaps someone who is introverted, shy, or perhaps isn't expressive.
